# B2MML
B2MML is an XML implementation of the ANSI/ISA-95, Enterprise-Control System Integration, family of standards (ISA-95), known internationally as IEC/ISO 62264. B2MML consists of a set of XML schemas written using the World Wide Web Consortium's XML Schema language (XSD) that implement the data models in the ISA-95 standard.

# BatchML
BatchML is an XML implementation of the ANSI/ISA-88, Batch Control, family of standards (ISA-88), known internationally as IEC 61512. BatchML consists of a set of XML schemas written using the World Wide Web Consortium's XML Schema language (XSD) that implements the models and terminology in the ISA-88 standard.

# B2MML-JSON
B2MML-JSON is a JSON Schema implementation of the ANSI/ISA-95 and ANSI/ISA-88 standards. The JSON schema (see json-schema.org for a full definition of JSON schemas) of B2MML and BatchML was generated using XMLSpy-2021 from the AllSchemas.xsd file.  There has been no checking of this file. There has been no testing of this file. It is intended for distribution to aid in checking the use of JSON in place of XML for data exchanges.  If any errors or problems are discovered in the use or the format, then issues should be raised on the GitHub site.
